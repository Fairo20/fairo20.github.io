            <ul>
                <li>Spells are WIP, probably could use some work but tentatively fine. Mostly elemental focused with some other thematic things and buff spells.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="Swordmage/Subclasses/Order of the Ancestral Hero.html">Order of the Ancestral Hero (demo)</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Currently leaning towards second idea of making the light and dark paths fully distinct. Very WIP</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="Swordmage/Subclasses/Order of the Blade Scrivener.html">Order of the Blade Scrivener</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Magical Circuit and Prepared Scrivener might be too strong, but the early levels are so incredibly rough (level 3 only features are blade and 1/lr +1d8 to one attack), desperately needs playtesting at all levels</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="Swordmage/Subclasses/Order of the Divine Guardian.html">Order of the Divine Guardian</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Radiant Ascenscion - not sure how valuable flight is so this is nerfed flight technically but thematic. Might need to change</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="Swordmage/Subclasses/Order of the Dragonshard.html">Order of the Dragonshard</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>I really like the theming, but Draconic Armory might be underwhelming or too strong but not interesting. I think Draconic Blessing is really cool but idk about it. Dragon's Descent is similar, seems cool but idk if it actually is.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="Swordmage/Subclasses/Order of the Shadow Templar.html">Order of the Shadow Templar</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is simple but hard to evaluate because of it, either its too strong for how simple it is or its just boring. Needs playtesting</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="Swordmage/Subclasses/Order of the Starry Knight.html">Order of the Starry Knight</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Potentially way too strong, saveless damage with Gravitational Pressure is insane and you have a lot of forced movement. Hopefully it's relatively fine other than that, damage has been nerfed a good bit and movement is a bit harder to achieve.</li>
