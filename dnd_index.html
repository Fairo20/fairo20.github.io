                <li>Currently leaning towards second idea of making the light and dark paths fully distinct.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Magical Circuit and Prepared Scrivener might be too strong, I'm hoping it's balanced out by the restrictions it places on your subclass spells but idk</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Radiant Ascenscion - not sure how valuable flight is so this is nerfed flight technically but thematic. Might need to change</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Kinda prototype, name and conventions are a bit unsure. I like the theming, and I really like Draconic Armory and Dragon's Blessing and Channeled Element. The rest I'm unsure on</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Worried about this being slightly too weak, but theoretically you have a lot of good access to CC, Darkness should feel good to cast with Obscure Light, and Concealed Strike seems strong considering it's resourceless</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="Swordmage/Subclasses/Order of the Starry Knight.md">Order of the Starry Knight</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Potentially way too strong, saveless damage with Gravitational Pressure is insane and you have a lot of forced movement. Hopefully it's relatively fine other than that.</li>
