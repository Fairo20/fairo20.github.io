						Infinite Recharge Score Calculator
				</a>
				<div class="projectDescrip">
					This project is a fully front-end webapp designed to calculate the score of a match of the 2020 FIRST Robotics Competition game, Infinite Recharge. The main feature is the queue, which enables both the undo and redo functions. This allows for users to take back incorrect inputs and redo accidental undo statements.

						HowdyHack 2021 Project: VTuber Soundboard
				</a>
				<div class="projectDescrip">
					This project was completed in 8 hours for HowdyHack 2021, Texas A&M's annual fall hackathon. It utilizes a similar queue system to the <a href="Infinite_Recharge/Score_Calculator_2020.html">Score Calculator</a> detailed above, however it stores music files instead of numbers. This soundboard also utilizes the Howl.js library in order to adjust the volume and speed of the assets.
