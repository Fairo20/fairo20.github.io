						TAMU Robomasters 2021-Present Repository (Current Framework)

				<div class="projectDescrip">
					I worked as a general feature developer for the Texas A&M Robomasters Embedded Systems team from Fall 2020 - Spring 2022, and am serving as the Embedded Systems lead for the Fall 2022 - Spring 2023 season. I worked on the Sentry robot with sensor integrations for the base framework from 2020-2021, and the implementation of a new framework & scheduler that required a rewrite of most of the codebase in the Fall 2021 - Spring 2022 season. For the Fall 2022 - Spring 2023 season, information can be found <a href="https://github.com/Fairo20/2022-2023-Robomasters-Organization" target="_blank" class="link"> here </a>.

					These are the repositories for the robots created by FRC Team 1138 programmed during the 2019 and 2020 FRC Season. I led the programming team during the 2019 year, and executively managed both the programming team and the electronics team in 2020, which consisted of member and project management, deadlines, system requirements and restraints, and communication between the software and hardware.

						Infinite Recharge Score Calculator
				</a>
				<div class="projectDescrip">
					This project is a fully front-end webapp designed to calculate the score of a match of the 2020 FIRST Robotics Competition game, Infinite Recharge. The main feature is the queue, which enables both the undo and redo functions. This allows for users to take back incorrect inputs and redo accidental undo statements.

						HowdyHack 2021 Project: VTuber Soundboard
				</a>
				<div class="projectDescrip">
					This project was completed in 8 hours for HowdyHack 2021, Texas A&M's annual fall hackathon. It utilizes a similar queue system to the <a href="Infinite_Recharge/Score_Calculator_2020.html">Score Calculator</a> detailed above, however it stores music files instead of numbers. This soundboard also utilizes the Howl.js library in order to adjust the volume and speed of the assets.
