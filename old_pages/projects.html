                This project is my current topic of research, optimized data structures for C++ architectures. The finished product is a fully portable library of unique data structures with different uses, all of which have a significant speedup over their competitors, as well as other advantages. The paper has been accepted and can be seen above, and is in the process of being published through the TAMU OAKTrust Digital Repository. The GitHub repository will be made available soon.

            <div class="projectDescrip">
                This project was completed as the final project of CS435, Parallel Computing, in which I created a GPU Merge Sort algorithm in CUDA and compared it to a standard parallel merge sort, as well as other members' different sorting algorithms. This was ran on the Texas A&M Grace computing cluster using Lawrence-Livermore National Laboratory's Caliper and Thicket data collection systems for GPU and CPU parallelized timing.

                NOTE: Code is proprietary, so these are the prototype video and picture from my final intern presentation <br>
                As shown, I developed a prototype wireless robot utilizing an STM32 microcontroller running Micropython, L298N motor controllers, an ADXL345 accelerometer, and an Orange Pi 3 running a minimal Debian installation for wireless communication. This prototype was intended to be a starting point for a design concept to navigate a server room autonomously to perform routine maintenance. Other topics of my internship included the development of a vision dataset for Fujitsu servers, setting up new Py boards for the development team, and developing a patent proposal for a server rack attachment mechanism.

                NOTE: Due to operational costs, the frontend is still hosted <a href="https://smook-app.web.app" class="link">here</a>, however the backend is not currently hosted so items will not correctly populate. A demo can be provided upon further inquiry.<br>
                This project is a fullstack web application designed to create a smoother ordering system for Smoothie King. I was in charge of the backend and hosting solutions, which were created using Java Spring Boot, with the backend hosted on Google Cloud and the frontend hosted on Firebase. The frontend of the system was created primarily through Vue.js, and communication between the two was handled via the Spring API and the Vue shop manager. This project was created using the Agile system, and I can provide the documentation for this upon further contact.

                This project was completed in 2 weeks in Fall 2022, which involved creating an HTML-JS front-end, a connected MySQL database, and a Java back-end created with Spring Boot to allow for requests to and from the front-end and the database. The project allows for a "dating experience" between users, and features automatic scheduling, User and Admin priviledges, triggered titles, and reviews for scheduled dates.

                I worked as a general feature developer for the Texas A&M Robomasters Embedded Systems team from Fall 2020 - Spring 2022, and am serving as the Embedded Systems lead for the Fall 2022 - Spring 2023 season. I worked on the Sentry robot with sensor integrations for the base framework from 2020-2021, and the implementation of a new framework & scheduler that required a rewrite of most of the codebase in the Fall 2021 - Spring 2022 season. For the Fall 2022 - Spring 2023 season, information can be found <a href="https://github.com/Fairo20/2022-2023-Robomasters-Organization" target="_blank" class="link"> here </a>. \nIf you'd like a look at the finished product, please take a look at these videos of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brCY652yTNw" target ="_blank" class="link">1v1 Competition (1st Place)</a> and our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkwWFsZaGCE" target="_blank" class="link">3v3 Competition (3rd Place)</a> matches from Summer 2023 at the Robomasters North America competition in Seattle.

                These are the repositories for the robots created by FRC Team 1138 programmed during the 2019 and 2020 FRC Season. I led the programming team during the 2019 year, and executively managed both the programming team and the electronics team in 2020, which consisted of member and project management, deadlines, system requirements and restraints, and communication between the software and hardware.

                This project is a fully front-end webapp designed to calculate the score of a match of the 2020 FIRST Robotics Competition game, Infinite Recharge. The main feature is the queue, which enables both the undo and redo functions. This allows for users to take back incorrect inputs and redo accidental undo statements.

                This project was completed in 8 hours for HowdyHack 2021, Texas A&M's annual fall hackathon. It utilizes a similar queue system to the <a href="Infinite_Recharge/Score_Calculator_2020.html" class="link">Score Calculator</a> detailed above, however it stores music files instead of numbers. This soundboard also utilizes the Howl.js library in order to adjust the volume and speed of the assets.
