You are a duelist in New Duel City. Your mission is to explore the city, collect cards for your deck, and defeat your rivals. But in order to do that, you must master the art of the Motorcycle Duel, the premier event of New Duel City by which all important decisions are based on. Duel and ride your way to the top! 
# Players: Create Characters

1. Choose a style for your character: **Street Urchin**, **Rich Kid**, **Nerd**, **Cool Guy**, **Bully Turned Friend**, or **Parental Figure**.
    
2. Choose a role for your character: **Grinder**, **Prodigy**, **Technician**, **Specialist**, **Sabateur**, or **Businessman**.
    
3. Choose your number, from 2 to 5. A high number means you are better at **Cards** (calm action, planning, strategic moves, logical deduction). A low number means you’re better at **Motorcycles** (risk taking, changing plans, fast talking, emotional deduction).
    
4. Choose your Deck Master

# Rolling the Dice

When you do something risky, roll 1d6 to find out how it goes. Roll +1d if you’re prepared and +1d if you’re an expert. (The GM tells you how many dice to roll, based on your character and the situation.) Roll your dice and compare each die result to your number.

⇧If you’re using Cards, you want to roll under your number

⇩If you’re using Motorcycles, you want to roll over your number.

0: If none of your dice succeed, it goes wrong. The GM says how things get worse somehow.

1: If one die succeeds, it you barely manage it. The GM inflicts a complication, harm, or cost.

2: If two dice succeed, you do it well. Good job!

3: If three dice succeed, you get a critical success! The GM tells you some extra effect you get.

! If you roll your number exactly, you have Cards on Motorcycles! You get a special insight into what’s going on. Ask the GM a question and they’ll answer you honestly. Some good questions:

What are they really feeling? Who’s behind this? How could I get them to do what I want? What should I be on the lookout for? What’s the best way to do this thing? What’s really going on here?

You can change your action if you want to, then roll again.

Helping: If you want to help someone else who’s rolling, say how you try to help and make a roll. If you succeed, give them +1d.

# Dueling

When a PC enters a duel against an NPC or another PC, begin a Duel Episode
At the start of a duel, both duelists have 8000 Life Points. Both duelists roll 1d6, and whoever rolls higher goes first (tie rerolls). On each players turn, they can choose to either Accelerate or Play. If they Accelerate, roll Motorcycles. They travel a number of laps equal to the number of dice that succeeded. If they Play, roll Cards. Their opponents loses (1000 Life Points x the amount of laps they are ahead) for each die that succeeded. If they roll a Cards on Motorcycles, they may both Accelerate and Play for that die, in addition to asking the GM a question. The first player to reduce their opponent to 0 Life Points wins. 

## Sample Duel
Duelists A and B, both intermediate duelists who will roll 2 dice for each skill, enter a duel, and A goes first. 

Turn 1: A rolls Motorcycle and succeeds with both dice, going to 2 laps. B rolls Motorcycle and succeeds with both dice, going to 2 laps. 

Turn 2: A rolls Cards and succeeds with 1 die, reducing B to 7000 LP. B rolls Motorcycle and succeeds with both dice, going to 4 laps. 

Turn 3: A rolls Cards and succeeds with both dice, reducing B to 5000 LP. B rolls Motorcycle and succeeds with both dice, going to 6 laps. 

Turn 4: A rolls Motorcycle and succeeds with both dice, advancing to 4 laps. B rolls Cards and succeeds with one die, reducing A to 6000 LP.

Turn 5: A rolls Motorcycle and succeeds with both dice, advancing to 6 laps. B rolls Motorcycle and succeeds with two dice, advancing to 8 laps. 

Turn 6: A rolls Motorcycle and succeeds with one die, advancing to 7 laps. B rolls Cards and succeeds with two dice, reducing A to 2000 LP.

Turn 7: A rolls Motorcycle and gets a success and a Cards on Motorcycles, advancing to 9 laps and reducing B to 3000 LP. B rolls Motorcycle and fails, staying at 8 laps.

Turn 8: A rolls Cards and succeeds with one die, reducing B to 1000 LP. B rolls Cards and gets a Cards on Motorcycles, advancing to 9 laps and reducing A to 1000 LP.

Turn 9: A rolls Cards and gets a Cards on Motorcycles, advacing to 10 laps and reducing B to 0 LP. A wins!

# GM: Run the Game

Play to find out how they defeat the threat. Introduce the threat by showing evidence of its recent badness. Before a threat does something to the characters, show signs that it’s about to happen, then ask what they do.

Call for a roll when the situation is uncertain. Don’t pre-plan outcomes. Let the chips fall where they may. Use failures to push the action forward. The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill.

Ask questions and build on the answers.
