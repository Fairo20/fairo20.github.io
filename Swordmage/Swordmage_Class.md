### Level 1: Half Caster
Swordmages connect with the arcane world through their blades. As they weave through the air, they bind the arcane to the material world, allowing Swordmages to access the Weave itself and twist it to benefit their needs. 

**Cantrips**: You know two cantrips of your choice from the Swordmage spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional Swordmage cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Swordmage table. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace on of the Swordmage cantrips you know with another cantrip from the Swordmage spell list. 

**Spells Known**: You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Swordmage spell list. The Spells Known column of the Swordmage table shows when you learn more Swordmage spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For isntance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Swordmage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the [Swordmage spell list](https://fairo20.github.io/Swordmage/Swordmage_Spells.html), which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spell Slots**: The Swordmage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Swordmage spells of 1st level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Shield using either slot. 

**Spellcasting Ability**: Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Swordmage spells, since their power derives from your knowledge and implementation of the abstract arcane arts. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Swordmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Level 1: Swordmage Bonding
Swordmages are defined by their bond with their weapons, an art that has transcended the ages. By meditating with their weapon, they can gain an arcane connection to their blade. During a rest, you may choose one weapon you are in possession of, and become bonded to that weapon. If you do so, any previous bond is broken. While a weapon is bonded, gain the following effects
- You may use your bonded weapon as a spellcasting focus.
- While you are wielding your bonded weapon, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This is increased to +3 if you have one hand free. 
- If the weapon is within 60ft, you may recall it to your hand as a bonus action
- If the weapon is on your person, when you would make an attack or cast a spell, you may instantly summon it to your hand.
- If the weapon is broken or damaged, you can recreate the weapon by meditating on a fragment of the weapon during a rest.

### Level 1: Swordmage Aegis
The key conviction of a Swordmage is to defend allies against those who may do them harm, and they understand how to channel the arcane energy within the world to ward against enemy advances. As a bonus action, you may mark an enemy within 15ft with your Swordmage Aegis. While marked, subtract 1d4 from attack rolls targetting allies other than you. When you mark an enemy with this feature, any other existing marks end. 

### Level 2: Aegis Defender

- **Aegis of Ensnarement** - When the marked target damages an ally within 60ft, you can use your reaction to teleport the marked target to an empty space adjacent to you. If you do so, creatures have advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of your next turn.
