### Level 1: Spellcasting
Swordmages connect with the arcane world through their blades. As they weave through the air, they bind the arcane to the material world, allowing Swordmages to access the Weave itself and twist it to benefit their needs. 

**Cantrips**: You know two cantrips of your choice from the Swordmage spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional Swordmage cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Swordmage table. When you gain a level in this class, you may replace on of the Swordmage cantrips you know with another cantrip from the Swordmage spell list. 

**Spells Known**: You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Swordmage spell list. The Spells Known column of the Swordmage table shows when you learn more Swordmage spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you may learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you may choose one of the Swordmage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Swordmage spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spell Slots**: The Swordmage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Swordmage spells of 1st level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you may cast Shield using either slot. 

**Spellcasting Ability**: Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Swordmage spells, since their power derives from your knowledge and implementation of the abstract arcane arts. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Swordmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Level 1: Swordmage Bonding
Swordmages are defined by their bond with their weapons, an art that has transcended the ages. By meditating with their weapon, they gain an arcane connection to their blade. During a rest, you may choose one melee weapon you are in possession of, and become bonded to that weapon. If you do so, any previous bond is broken. While a weapon is bonded, gain the following effects
- You may use your bonded weapon as a spellcasting focus.
- While you are wielding your bonded weapon, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This is increased to +3 if you have one hand free. 
- If the weapon is within 60ft, you may recall it to your hand as a bonus action
- If the weapon is on your person, when you would make an attack or cast a spell, you may instantly summon it to your hand.
- If the weapon is broken or damaged, you may recreate the weapon by meditating on a fragment of the weapon during a rest.

### Level 1: Swordmage Aegis
The key conviction of a Swordmage is to defend allies against those who may do them harm, and they understand how to channel the arcane energy within the world to ward against enemy advances. As a bonus action, you may mark an enemy within 15ft with your Swordmage Aegis. While marked, subtract 1d4 from attack rolls targeting allies other than you. When you mark an enemy with this feature, any other existing marks end. 

### Level 2: Aegis Defender
As your familiarity with your Aegis expands, you learn to react to attempts to harm your allies. Select one of the following paths upon reaching level 2 in this class.
- **Aegis of Assault** - When a marked enemy within 60ft damages an ally, you may use your reaction to teleport to an empty space adjacent to that enemy and make a melee weapon attack against them.
- **Aegis of Ensnarement** - When a marked enemy within 60ft damages an ally, you may use your reaction to teleport that enemy to an empty space adjacent to you. If you do so, creatures have advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of your next turn.
- **Aegis of Shielding** - When a marked enemy within 60ft damages an ally, you may use your reaction to give them resistance to that damage.

### Level 2: Aegis Boon
Each Swordmage manifests their Aegis in different, unique ways. Gain a boon from the below list. You gain another boon at levels 7, 11, and 15.
- **Aegis of Assault Boons**
	- **Disruptive Assault** - When you use your Aegis Defender feature, you may choose to make your melee weapon attack at disadvantage. If you do so and hit, deal damage as normal. Reduce the damage taken by an ally by the amount of damage you dealt
	- **Escalating Assault** - When you use your Aegis Defender feature, an ally damaged by the triggering enemy may use their reaction to make a weapon attack against them or move half their speed, ignoring attacks of opportunity. 
	- **Vigorous Assault** - When you use your Aegis Defender feature and you hit with your melee weapon attack, you may gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt
- **Aegis of Ensnarement Boons**
	- **Blinding Ensnarement** - When you use your Aegis Defender feature, the triggering enemy must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn
	- **Diverting Ensnarement** - When you use your Aegis Defender feature, you may choose to become the target of the triggering action and receive any damage and effects of the attack instead of your ally
	- **Grasping Ensnarement** - When you use your Aegis Defender feature, the triggering enemy treats all terrain as difficult terrain until the end of your next turn
- **Aegis of Shielding Boons**
	- **Enhanced Shielding** - When you use your Aegis Defender feature, you may also reduce the damage dealt by your Constitution modifier after applying resistance
	- **Reflective Shielding** - When you use your Aegis Defender feature, you may deal damage to the triggering enemy equal to half the amount of damage prevented
	- **Siphoning Shielding** - When you use your Aegis Defender feature, you may gain temporary HP equal to half the amount of damage prevented
- **General Boons**
	- **Aegis Parry** - Whenever a marked enemy within 60ft attacks you, you may use your reaction to force them to roll at disadvantage
	- **Distant Aegis** - Double the range at which you may mark enemies with your Swordmage Aegis feature
	- **Marked Strike** - If you deal damage to a marked enemy, add your proficiency bonus to the damage
	- **Regenerative Aegis** - Whenever a marked enemy within 60ft misses with an attack, you may gain proficiency bonus temporary hit points
	- **Shared Warding** - Adjacent allies gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are wielding your bonded weapon

### Level 3: Arcane Order
When you reach 3rd level, you are officially inducted into your Arcane Order, as signified by gaining access to your order's signature blade. You have been in training before, but now you are a full-fledged Swordmage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. Those features include order spells.

[Order of the Blade Scrivener](https://fairo20.github.io/Swordmage/Subclasses/Order%20of%20the%20Blade%20Scrivener.html)

[Order of the Divine Guardian](https://fairo20.github.io/Swordmage/Subclasses/Order%20of%20the%20Divine%20Guardian.html)

[Order of the Dragonshard](https://fairo20.github.io/Swordmage/Subclasses/Order%20of%20the%20Dragonshard.html)

[Order of the Shadow Templar](https://fairo20.github.io/Swordmage/Subclasses/Order%20of%20the%20Shadow%20Templar.html)

[Order of the Starry Knight](https://fairo20.github.io/Swordmage/Subclasses/Order%20of%20the%20Starry%20Knight.html)

### Level 3: Student of the Past
Your study of the arcane and its history has led you to recognize the patterns when they occur within magical effects. Choose Arcana or History. If you are not proficient in this skill, you become proficient in it. If you are already proficient in it, you may double your proficiency bonus in that skill. In addition, you have advantage on Intelligence checks to identify a spell or spell effect, or to understand the use or history of a weapon or magical item.  

### Level 4: Ability Score Increase
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, and 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. In addition to this, you can choose to take a feat for which you qualify for.

### Level 5: Combat Casting
Swordmages are masters of weaving spell and blade, turning the momentum of one into power of the other. When you take the Cast a Spell action to cast a leveled spell, your weapon attacks are made at advantage during your next turn. When you take the Attack action and deal damage to an enemy, the first spell you cast during your next turn may be cast as if it were one level higher than the spell slot expended. 

### Level 5: Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the options below. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. 
- **Blind Fighting**: You gain Blindsight to a range of 20ft. Additionally, you can see invisible creatures within the radius of your blindsight as long as they are not hidden from you.
- **Dual Wielder**: When you make the extra attack of a weapon with the light property, you can add your ability modifier to the damage. Additionally, you have a +1 to AC while dual wielding with a light weapon.
- **Duelist**: When you are wielding a one handed weapon and no other weapons, you can add +2 to the damage of that weapon. Additionally, when you are hit with a melee attack, you can use yoru reaction to parry and add +2 to your AC for that attack.
- **Mobile**: Your movement speed increases by 10ft. Additionally, when you make a melee attack against a creature, you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of your turn.
- **Savage Attacker**: Your melee attacks crit on a roll of 19 or 20. Additionally, when you make a critical hit, you roll an additional die of damage. 

### Level 6: Arcane Order Feature
You become more advanced in your order as your studies and experiences lead you to further breakthroughs in knowledge. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. 

### Level 7: Double Aegis
Your greater focus allows you to defend against multiple enemies at once. You may mark up to two enemies using the same bonus action. If you mark any creatures this way, any previously existing marks end. 
In addition, whenever you deal damage with a melee weapon attack, you may mark that enemy. This does not end any existing marks.  

### Level 8: Ability Score Increase
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, and 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. In addition to this, you can choose to take a feat for which you qualify for.

### Level 9: Energizing Ward
Whenever you are dealt damage by a marked enemy, your sword absorbs some of the energy and channels it back into you, as you capture some of the essence of the aggressor. You may gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt, rounded down. You may use this feature proficiency bonus times per long rest.

### Level 10: Arcane Order Feature
You become more advanced in your order as your studies and experiences lead you to further breakthroughs in knowledge. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. 

### Level 11: Greater Defender 
With greater familiarity with your Aegis, you are now effortlessly able to manipulate your enemies. Once per rest, you may use your Aegis Defender feature without consuming your reaction. In addition, your Aegis Defender feature gains the following upgrade:

**Aegis of Assault**: You have advantage on the melee weapon attack. 

**Aegis of Ensnarement**: You may teleport into the space the affected enemy originally occupied. 

**Aegis of Shielding**: You may teleport the affected ally to a space adjacent to you.  

### Level 12: Ability Score Increase
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, and 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. In addition to this, you can choose to take a feat for which you qualify for.

### Level 13: Arcane Mind
Your experience with warding against the onslaught of enemies has taught you patterns that you can recognize in the moment to avoid dangerous situations. Whenever you would make a saving throw against a spell or effect, you may instead choose to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a success, you are unaffected by that spell or effect, as you deduce what will occur and make the necessary moves to avoid it. You may only use this feature proficiency bonus times per long rest. 

### Level 14: Arcane Order Feature
You become more advanced in your order as your studies and experiences lead you to further breakthroughs in knowledge. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. 

### Level 15: Total Aegis
Your defensive magic has no bounds, as you ward against the crash of incoming armies. When you mark targets with your Aegis, you may now choose to mark any number of targets within range. If you mark any creatures this way, any previously existing marks end.

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, and 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. In addition to this, you can choose to take a feat for which you qualify for.
