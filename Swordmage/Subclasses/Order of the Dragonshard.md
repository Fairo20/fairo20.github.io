#### Feature: Elemental Blade
As a bonus action, you can activate your blade for one minute. While active, it takes on characteristics of your dragon order, as scales cover the blade and your element enshrouds it. Whenever you deal damage with your Elemental Blade, add 1d4 of your elemental affiliation to the damage. 
#### Feature: Draconic Armory
When you activate your Elemental Blade, you gain access to your Draconic Armory, as the elemental energy from your blade covers your body. You gain resistance to the damage type of your elemental affiliation. In addition, if you would take damage that is less than or equal to your Int mod + your Con mod, you instead take no damage. 
### Level 6
#### Feature: Elemental Burst
Once per turn, when you deal damage with your Elemental Blade, all enemies in a 15ft cone originating from you towards the enemy you hit must make a Dex save. On a failure, they take damage equal to your Int modifier number of d6s (damage type is of your elemental affiliation). On a success they take half damage. 
### Level 10
#### Feature: Dragon's Blessing
As a Bonus Action while your Elemental Blade is active, you may designate one ally within 60ft as the target of your Dragon's Blessing. Whenever that ally is within 60ft of you and is damaged by an enemy, you may use your Aegis Defender feature, regardless of whether the enemy is marked or not. This effect ends when your Elemental Blade is dismissed. You may only use this feature once per short rest. 
### Level 14
#### Feature: Channeled Element
Whenever you deal damage of your elemental affiliation type to one or more enemies, you are able to harness some of the energy into your blade. Each time this occurs, increase the damage of your Elemental Blade by 1d4. This effect stacks, and resets upon the dismissal of your Elemental Blade. 
### Level 18
#### Feature: Dragon's Descent
As you raise your blade and utter a cry, the dragon's full might enters you by your blade from the heavens. Once per long rest, you may cast True Polymorph on yourself, choosing to become a Dragon of type chosen for your elemental affiliation. This lasts for 1 minute, at which point you revert back to your normal form and gain 1 point of exhaustion.
