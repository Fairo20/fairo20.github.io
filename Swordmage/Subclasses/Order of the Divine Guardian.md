#### Feature: Radiant Blade
As a bonus action, you can activate your blade for one minute. While active, your blade glows with holy light, and sheds bright light in a 10ft radius. Whenever you deal damage with your Radiant Blade, add 1d4 radiant damage. 

#### Feature: Healing Strike
Your blade, when activated, can tell friend from foe. When you make a melee weapon attack with your Radiant Blade, you may choose to instead attack an ally within range. If you do so, they regain hit points equal to your damage roll instead. You may use this feature twice per short rest, and may regain a use of it by casting a leveled spell. 

### Level 6
#### Feature: Radiant Beam
When you take the Attack action with your Radiant Blade, your attack range increases to 60ft, as you slice your blade and form a holy projectile slash. This attack counts as a melee weapon attack for the purposes of your class features.

### Level 10
#### Feature: Radiant Intervention
You may now use your Aegis Defender feature when a marked enemy affects an ally with a spell or effect. 

### Level 14
#### Feature: Guardian Angel
While your Radiant Blade is active, you may use a Bonus Action to activate this feature. While this feature is active, you have a fly speed equal to twice your speed, however whenever you move this way, you must end your turn adjacent to an ally or a marked enemy. This effect ends when your Radiant Blade is dismissed.

### Level 18
#### Feature: Divine Permanence
Your divine radiance knows no bounds. You gain the following effects:
- There is no limit to the amount of times you may use your Healing Strike feature. 
- Whenever you make a weapon attack, you may immediately make a Healing Strike. 
- The range of your Radiant Beam becomes 120ft.
- Your Guardian Angel fly speed becomes 5 times your speed. 

### Concepts

If I want Guardian Angel to be simpler:
#### Feature: Guardian Angel
While your Radiant Blade is active, you may use a Bonus Action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5ft of an ally or a marked enemy. You can only use this feature prof bonus times per long rest.
