### Level 3
#### Spells
You learn additional spells when you learn spells of specific levels, as shown on the Shadow Templar Magic table. Each spell counts as a Swordmage spell for you, but it doesn't count agains the number of Swordmage spells you know. These spells can't be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

#### Feature: Inkblade
As a bonus action, you can activate your blade for one minute. While active, it seemingly disappears from sight, leaving behind only an inky blackness trailing from the hilt. Whenever you deal damage with your Inkblade, add 1d6 necrotic damage.  

#### Feature: Inky Darkness
When you deal damage with your Inkblade, its darkness begins to enshroud the vision of those it hits. Enemies who take damage from your Inkblade must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. You may use this feature once per rest, and may regain use of it by taking the Cast a Spell action. 

### Level 6
#### Feature: Concealed Strike
Whenever you attack an enemy who cannot see you with your Inkblade, you may add your Intelligence modifier to the attack and damage. 

### Level 10
#### Feature: Obscure Light
You learn the Darkness spell, and you may cast it as a Bonus Action without expending a spell slot. The spell does not use your Concentration if cast this way, and you and your allies can see through it. 

### Level 14
#### Feature: Exposed Wickedness
When you attack a marked enemy with your Inkblade, their internalized darkness manifests externally. When you take the Attack action, if you deal damage to a marked target, you may force them to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, their shadow erupts, dealing 2d6 necrotic damage and blinding all enemies within 30ft. 

### Level 18
#### Feature: Esoteric Executioner
When you make an attack against an enemy with your Inkblade, if they are both blinded and marked, you automatically critically hit.
