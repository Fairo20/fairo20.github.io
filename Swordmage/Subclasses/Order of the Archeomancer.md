#### Feature: Runic Blade
As a bonus action, you can activate your blade for one minute. While active, the runes enscribed in your blade begin to glow. Whenever you deal damage with your Runic Blade, add 1d4 force damage. 

#### Feature: Spell Runes
The spells you gain from this subclass are magically inscribed into your blade as Spell Runes. Once per turn, when you take the Attack action and hit with your Runic Blade, you may expend one Spell Rune inscribed into your blade. If you do so, you may add 1d8 to the damage roll for each level of the Spell Rune you expended. You may not cast the spell associated with that Spell Rune until your next long rest, at which point the Spell Rune is refreshed.

### Level 6
#### Feature: Sword Ritual
Choose 3 ritual spells from the Wizard spell list of a level you can learn. Inscribe these spells into the hilt of your weapon. You may ritually cast these spells by infusing your power into these runes. These runes do not count as Spell Runes. Whenever you gain a level, you may swap one of these spells for another Wizard ritual spell of a level you can learn.
You can scribe ritual spells into your blade, in the same way Wizards can scribe spells into their spellbook. 

### Level 10
#### Feature: Magical Circuit
You have learned how to preserve some of the magical energy you channel through your blade. When you cast a leveled spell, you may regain use of an expended Spell Rune of a lower level, enabling you to recast the spell or expend the rune again. You may only use this feature once per Spell Rune, refreshed on a long rest. 

### Level 14
#### Feature: Prepared Scrivener
You have committed the arcane arts to memory, and are able to scribe on the go. During a rest, you can choose one spell of a level you can learn from the Wizard spell list and replace your subclass spell of the same level with it. If that rune was previously expended it is still expended. 

### Level 18
#### Feature: Reactive Scribing
When you are targeted by a spell, you may make a DC 20 Arcana check. If you succeed, you may store that spell as a Temporary Spell Rune in your blade. You may only have 1 Temporary Spell Rune at any time. While you have this Temporary Spell Rune, you may cast the spell without using a spell slot at the level it was originally cast or expend the rune like normal, but the rune disappears after use.
