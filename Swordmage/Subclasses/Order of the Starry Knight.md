#### Feature: Cosmic Blade
As a bonus action, you can activate your blade for one minute. While active, it begins to glow with constellation patterns, dotting down the blade. Whenever you deal damage with your Elemental Blade, add 1d4 force damage. 
#### Feature: Gravitational Pull
When you deal damage with your Cosmic Blade, you call upon the forces of the cosmos to bind your opponent. Choose a square within 15ft. They must make a Strength saving throw vs your spell save DC or be pulled to that square. Until the end of their next turn, they must spend 1ft of additional movement for every 1ft they move. You may use this feature once per short rest, and may regain use of this feature by casting a spell.
### Level 6
#### Feature: Opposites Attract
Whenever you deal damage to an enemy with your Cosmic Blade, you may force them to make a Strength save. If they fail, choose one marked enemy other than your attack target. Your attack target is pulled into the closest adjacent tile to that marked enemy.
### Level 10
#### Feature: Gravitational Pressure
Whenever you would force an enemy to move, you may deal damage to them equal to your Int modifier for every 10ft they would move, rounded up. 
For example, pushing an enemy 5 or 10 feet would deal 1 * Int mod, 15-20 would deal 2 * Int mod, etc.
### Level 14
#### Feature: Likes Repel
You may use your Action to activate this feature. If there are two or more enemies currently marked, those enemies cannot move within 30ft of each other. If the distance between them is less than 30ft, they are both immediately pushed away from each other until the distance between them is at least 30ft, both moving at least 5ft. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. You may only use this feature prof bonus times per long rest.
### Level 18
#### Feature: Call Upon the Stars
Once per short rest, you may cast the Gravity Fissure spell without expending a spell slot. Once per long rest, you may cast the Reverse Gravity spell without expending a spell slot.
