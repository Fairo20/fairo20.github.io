#### Feature: Cosmic Blade
As a bonus action, you can activate your blade for one minute. While active, it begins to glow with constellation patterns, dotting down the blade. Whenever you deal damage with your Cosmic Blade, add 1d4 force damage. 

#### Feature: Gravitational Pull
When you take the Attack action while your Cosmic Blade is activated, you call upon the forces of the cosmos to bind your opponent. On hit, choose an unoccupied space within 15ft. Your attack target must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled to that square. Until the end of their next turn, they must spend 1ft of additional movement for every 1ft they move. You may only use this feature once per rest, and may regain use of it by taking the Cast a Spell action to cast a leveled spell. 

### Level 6
#### Feature: Opposites Attract
As a bonus action while your Cosmic Blade is active, you may force a marked enemy within 60ft to make a Strength saving throw. If they fail, you may pull them to an unoccupied space adjacent to you. If there are more than one enemy marked, you may instead have them be pulled into the closest adjacent tile to any other marked enemy within 60ft. You may only use this feature proficiency bonus times per long rest.  

### Level 10
#### Feature: Gravitational Pressure
Whenever you would force an enemy within 60ft to move, you may deal force damage to them equal to your Intelligence modifier (movement counts pushes, pulls, teleports, and otherwise forced movement such as the Levitate spell) 

### Level 14
#### Feature: Likes Repel
You may activate this feature as a bonus action. If there are two or more enemies currently marked, those enemies cannot move within 15ft of each other. If the distance between them is less than 15ft, they are both immediately pushed away from each other until the distance between them is at least 15ft. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. You may only use this feature proficiency bonus times per long rest.

### Level 18
#### Feature: Call Upon the Stars
Once per rest, you may cast the Gravity Fissure spell without expending a spell slot. Once per long rest, you may cast the Reverse Gravity spell without expending a spell slot.
