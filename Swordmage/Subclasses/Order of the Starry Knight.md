#### Feature: Cosmic Blade
As a bonus action, you can activate your blade for one minute. While active, it begins to glow with constellation patterns, dotting down the blade. Whenever you deal damage with your Elemental Blade, add 1d4 force damage. 

#### Feature: Gravitational Pull
When you deal damage with your Cosmic Blade, you call upon the forces of the cosmos to bind your opponent. Choose an unoccupied space within 15ft. They must make a Strength saving throw vs your spell save DC or be pulled to that square. Until the end of their next turn, they must spend 1ft of additional movement for every 1ft they move. You may use this feature once per rest, and may regain use of this feature by casting a leveled spell.

### Level 6
#### Feature: Opposites Attract
While your Cosmic Blade is active, as a Bonus Action, you may force a marked enemy within 60ft to make a Strength save. If they fail, you may pull them to an unoccupied space adjacent to you. If there are more than one enemy marked, you may instead have them be pulled into the closest adjacent tile to any other marked enemy. You may only use this feature prof bonus times per long rest.  

### Level 10

This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. You may only use this feature prof bonus times per long rest.
