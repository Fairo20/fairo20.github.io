<h2 style="text-align:center"> Intro </h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
Everyone has temptations in their lives. For some, it may be lust, or sloth, or maybe even that desire 
to take an extra slice of cake when you know you shouldn’t (guilty as charged). Every person born through 
man has temptations brought to them in their lives, creating an everlasting battle between the powers of 
sin and the will of God. Too often, we as humans will lose a battle, succumbing to Satan’s forces and 
“falling” from God’s side. However, as the common quote goes, one can lose the battle and still win the war. 
The ultimate goal of living in God is to recognize that there are certain battles we can’t win, but as 
long as we trust in God and ask for forgiveness, we still can save the day, win the war, and reap the 
rewards.

<h2 style="text-align:center"> Recognizing Sin </h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
Today we are going to be looking at 1 Kings 16:29-33 and 1 Kings 17:1-6. Firstly, turn to 1 Kings 16, or 
use the handy link <a href = "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+16&version=NIV" target = "_blank"> here</a>. 
Looking at verse 29, it says that “Ahab, son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria over 
Israel twenty-two years. 30Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the eyes of the LORD than any of those before 
him.” The author lays this out pretty clearly: Ahab was an evil person, a person who had turned away from 
the Lord and a person who had accepted sin in the world as his reality. Next it goes to describe the evils 
of Ahab’s rule, including him “marry[ing] Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king…, and began to serve Baal and 
worship him.” 32He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he built in Samaria… 33and did more 
to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than did all the kings of Israel before him.” Ahab is not 
just a person who was born in sin; he is a person who accepts it as integral to his character and utilizes 
it just to strike at the Lord. This actually demonstrates the first part of living a fulfilled life through 
Christ: recognizing you are a sinner, and in this aspect, Ahab is perfect, however he does not only recognize 
his sin, he begins to worship it as the higher power. Think about what today consumes people so much that 
they often forget to focus on God. These are the sins the book is warning us of.

<h2 style="text-align:center"> God Provides for His People </h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
Next we move to Elijah, who represents the second of these ideas, that God will provide for those who follow him. 
Elijah was a simple man born during this time of anti-Christian sentiments, yet he remained faithful to the Lord 
throughout it all, leading to him becoming the prophet of God to the kingdom. Elijah’s faith leads to him being 
cast aside by the people and hunted down solely for being a Christian. God warns him to flee into the desert, a 
place historically symbolic of death, when God tells him “You will drink from the brook, and I have ordered the 
ravens to feed you there.” At this same time, God had sent a terrible curse on the people of Israel, creating 
the largest drought the land had seen. By commanding Elijah such, He looked out for the one who supported him 
through and through, guiding him to safety where he could prosper in the Lord. Think about the different ways 
that God has provided for you and how God will provide for you in the future for your faith. Pray to Him through 
temptation, and He will see you through it.
