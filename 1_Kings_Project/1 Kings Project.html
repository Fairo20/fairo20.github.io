<p style="text-align:center">
Everyone has temptations in their lives. For some, it may be lust, or sloth, or maybe even that desire 
to take an extra slice of cake when you know you shouldn’t (guilty as charged). Every person born through 
man has temptations brought to them in their lives, creating an everlasting battle between the powers of 
sin and the will of God. Too often, we as humans will lose a battle, succumbing to Satan’s forces and 
“falling” from God’s side. However, as the common quote goes, one can lose the battle and still win the war. 
The ultimate goal of living in God is to recognize that there are certain battles we can’t win, but as 
long as we trust in God and ask for forgiveness, we still can save the day, win the war, and reap the 
rewards.
