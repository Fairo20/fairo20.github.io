            The purpose of this paper was to create and analyze a fully portable library of unique data structures that have a significant speedup over their competitors, as well as other advantages. The GitHub link can be found <a href="https://github.com/Fairo20/vma" target="_blank">here</a>.

            This is a GPU Merge Sort algorithm in CUDA with a writeup comparing it to a standard parallel merge sort, as well as other members' different sorting algorithms. This was ran on the Texas A&M Grace computing cluster using Lawrence-Livermore National Laboratory's Caliper and Thicket data collection systems for GPU and CPU parallelized timing.

            This is a prototype wireless robot utilizing an STM32 microcontroller running Micropython, L298N motor controllers, an ADXL345 accelerometer, and an Orange Pi 3 running a minimal Debian installation for wireless communication. This prototype was intended to be a starting point for a design concept to navigate a server room autonomously to perform routine maintenance. Other topics of my internship included the development of a vision dataset for Fujitsu servers, setting up new Py boards for the development team, and developing a patent proposal for a server rack attachment mechanism.

            This is a fullstack web application designed to create a smoother ordering system for Smoothie King. I led the development of the backend and hosting solutions, which were created using Java Spring Boot, with the backend hosted on Google Cloud and the frontend hosted on Firebase. The frontend of the system was created primarily through Vue.js, and communication between the two was handled via the Spring API and the Vue shop manager. This project was created using the Agile system, and further documentation can be provided at request.

            This was a short-term project sculpting a concept dating app, which involved creating an HTML-JS front-end, a connected MySQL database, and a Java back-end created with Spring Boot to allow for requests to and from the front-end and the database. The project features automatic scheduling, User and Admin priviledges, triggered titles, and reviews for scheduled dates.

            I worked as a general feature developer for the Texas A&M Robomasters Embedded Systems team from Fall 2020 - Spring 2022, and served as the Embedded Systems lead for the Fall 2022 - Spring 2023 season. I worked on the Sentry robot with sensor integrations for the base framework from 2020-2021, and the implementation of a new framework & scheduler that required a rewrite of most of the codebase in the Fall 2021 - Spring 2022 season. For the Fall 2022 - Spring 2023 season project management documentation, information can be found <a href="https://github.com/Fairo20/2022-2023-Robomasters-Organization" target="_blank"> here </a>.<br/>If you'd like a look at the finished product, please take a look at these videos of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brCY652yTNw" target ="_blank">1v1 Competition (1st Place)</a> and our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkwWFsZaGCE" target="_blank">3v3 Competition (3rd Place)</a> matches from Summer 2023 at the Robomasters North America competition in Seattle.
